There's a strong need for designers with fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS and JS. So many websites and apps are using pre-built themes, which may get the job done as far as getting the word out, but not in terms of generating novel experiences and building strong brands. That's what keeps users coming back.

The best websites combine novel technologies with creative design. This is what I've built my skills towards and the value I hope to deliver.

Over the next few years, I hope to be building frontend design systems and providing art direction to global businesses.
