It seems to me that there's a strong need for developers with fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS and JS. With most new websites using pre-built themes, they eventually reach a point where they need to update their visual design to distinguish themselves.

This is best done with a holistic approach. Someone who understands the technology but can still build a distinct visual style. Otherwise you just end up with cookie-cutter websites or unnecessary overhead for the developers (aka wasted time, money, and energy).

**Over the next 5 years, I see my work lying somewhere between frontend architecture and design systems,** providing website-owners tools & practices to get their vision out to the world.
