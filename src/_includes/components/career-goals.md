It seems to me that there's a strong need for developers with fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS and JS. With most new websites using pre-built themes, they eventually reach a point where they need to update their visual design to distinguish themselves.

This is best done with a holistic approach. Someone who understands the technology but can still build a distinct visual style. Otherwise you just end up with cookie-cutter websites or unnecessary overhead for the developers (aka wasted time, money, and energy).

**Over the next 5 years, I see my work lying somewhere between frontend architecture and design systems,** providing website-owners tools & practices to get their vision out to the world.

Regarding compensation, my target rate is and has been $60/h for my last several projects (equivalent to a ~$120,000 salary). While it’s uncommon for job candidates to accept pay cuts in this industry, my priority has always been the work that I’m doing and how that fits in to my career. I’m happy to go as low as $70k for the right company and right opportunity, but It should go without saying that the my expectations for work/life balance are much higher in that case.
