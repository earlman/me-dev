### Colophon

This website was designed and coded from scratch by Earl Justin Mangulabnan. The data is stored in JSON, Markdown, and Nunjucks files. The styles were built with Vanilla CSS on top of my own SASS methodology, but that will likely get phased out as [CSS Nesting gets more browser support](https://caniuse.com/css-nesting).

These files are compiled to HTML/CSS/JS using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can see the code on [Github](https://github.com/earlman/me-dev).
