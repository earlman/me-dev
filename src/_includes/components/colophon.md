### Colophon

This website was designed and coded by Earl Justin Mangulabnan. The data is stored in JSON, Markdown, and Nunjucks files. The styles were built with Vanilla CSS on top of my own SASS methodology.

These files are compiled to HTML/CSS/JS using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can see the code on [Github](https://github.com/earlman/me-dev). As of August 2023, this site is undergoing heavy development. Come say to me on LinkedIn.
