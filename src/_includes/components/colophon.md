### Colophon

This website was designed and built from scratch by Earl Justin Mangulabnan. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is its primary technology. It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can see the code on [Github](https://github.com/earlman/me-dev). I'm not using any CDN. I'm adapting work from several creators 

This website is the professional portfolio of Earl Mangulabnan, hosted at dev.earlman.me. The source code is publicly available on GitHub.
The site is built using a variety of technologies:

- Eleventy (11ty): The site is built using Eleventy, a simpler static site generator. The Eleventy configuration can be found in the .eleventy.js file.
- Sass: Sass is used for creating the site's stylesheets. The Sass files can be found in the styles directory.
- Netlify: The site is deployed using Netlify, and the configuration for this can be found in the netlify.toml file.

The site's content, including portfolio pieces and work samples, is written in Markdown and can be found in the src directory.
