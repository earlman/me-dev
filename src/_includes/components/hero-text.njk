    My name is Earl Justin Mangulabnan.<br>
    I design and develop frontend systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like when things are<br>
    built well & built for everybody.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good web development means<br>
    much more than a pretty site.
  </p>
  <p>
    It means maintainable code, meaningful designs,<br>
    clean architecture,<br>
    well-defined processes, and<br>
    stellar communication.<br>
    A lofty ideal, I know,<br>
    but that just makes it the<br>
    best place to aim<br>
  </p>
