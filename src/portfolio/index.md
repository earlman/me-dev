Welcome to my portfolio page ðŸ˜Š

This is the generic version, but in many cases, I like to create a custom portfolio, tailored for prospective clients.  I don't think I'm alone in thinking that my experiences as a webdev go far beyond a generic portfolio. I'd rather show how I could be of service by understanding your business, first.

After you take a look at the projects below, if you're interested in what I have to offer, please take a second to answer a few questions: 
- What does your business do and what are you building?
- How did you, personally, end up taking on this work?
- What kind of work are you looking for help with?
- A link to your LinkedIn page (for validation purposes)

Feel free to write as much or as little as you want. The more detail you add, the better I can contextualize the work I can do.

You can also ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/earl-mangulabnan-5b0740109/) if you're worried I'll miss the email.
