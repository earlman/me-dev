This is the project I mentioned a couple times in our meeting. I don't mean to oversell it, but it's definitely is the best display of my skillset as a developer. Though it's a private repo, I have my client's permission to use it for my portfolio.

To access the site, use `NETHER-rustle-flea` for the initial Netlify password, and authenticate with the following:

```
username=earl.mangulabnan@gmail.com
password=12345678
```

If you'd like me to temporarily add you to the repo so that you can see the source code, let me know.
