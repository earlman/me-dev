Welcome to my brand new portfolio site. This has been on the back-burner, so I'm glad to finally be able crank it out. I got a little bit carried away, so it's coming to you later than I'd have hopedâ€”but I think it was time-well-spent. All the infrastructure will be reused in future job applications.

Let me know if you'd like any referral information. I haven't let any colleagues know that they might get a call/email regarding my job search, but I can do so next Monday.

### Cyber Admitted
This is the project I mentioned a couple times in our meeting. I don't mean to oversell it, but it's definitely is the best display of my skillset as a developer. Over the last 6 months, my focus has been on consistency, both in terms of communication and deliverables.

To access the site, use `PASSWORD` for the initial Netlify password, and

If you'd like me to temporarily add you to the repo so that you can see the source code, let me know.
