Welcome to my brand new portfolio site. This has been on the back-burner, so I'm glad to finally crank it out a v1. I got a little bit carried away, so it's coming to you later than I'd have hopedâ€”but I think it was time-well-spent. The infrastructure will be reused in future job applications.

Let me know if you'd like any referral information. I haven't let any colleagues know that they might get a call/email regarding my job search, but I can do so next Monday.

## Featured

{% include "components/featured-cyber-admitted.njk" %}

This is the project I mentioned a couple times in our meeting. I don't mean to oversell it, but it's definitely is the best display of my skillset as a developer. Though it's a private repo, I have permission to use it for my portfolio. 

To access the site, use `NETHER-rustle-flea` for the initial Netlify password, and authenticate with the following:

```
	username=earl.mangulabnan@gmail.com
	password=12345678
```

If you'd like me to temporarily add you to the repo so that you can see the source code, let me know.
