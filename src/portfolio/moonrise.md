## Featured Project

### [[Cyber Admitted]]

This is the project I mentioned a couple times in our meeting. I don't mean to oversell it, but it's definitely is the best display of my skillset as a developer. Over the last 6 months, my focus has been on consistentcy, both in terms of communication and deliverables.

To access the site, use `PASSWORD` for the initial Netlify password, and

```
	username=
	password=
```

==for the authentication.==

If you'd like me to temporarily add you to the repo so that you can see the source code, let me know.
