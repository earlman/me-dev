# Shipwright CSS

CSS/SASS Methodology

## Summary

In the very beginning of my professional webdev career, there seemed to be a million techniques for designing a website. None of the mainstream tools seemed to properly take advantage of the strengths of the CSS language, especially newer features such as CSS properties. This has absolutely been my favorite project throughout my career, thus far, and I use it in every project I start. While the docs and landing page need updating, the framework itself is still actively developed.

The [SASS files](https://github.com/foundations-design/Shipwright-Blueprints/) are the meat of the project. Essentially, it's the scaffolding I've been using throughout the years to style websites from scratch.

## Features

- [Docs](https://shipwright.foundations.design/docs/) built with [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) - Vuepress is my current recommendation for a quick, high-quality documentation setup. Shipwright's documentation was written several years ago, however, and there have been many changes since then.
- At one point, this project was compiling the styles with Github Actions and publishing the package on NPM, but that feature wasn't used enough to be worth maintaining.

## Tech

- Github Actions
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
